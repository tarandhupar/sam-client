      The new SAM.gov is a unified system that has modernized and integrated from 10 systems to one. Migrating the 10 legacy systems into one allows the new SAM.gov
      to be the central website for government award management. This new website will allow you to simply register and access data for all business opportunities with the government.

      The new SAM.gov helps with the identification of future bidding opportunities for re-occurring service contracts; determining which agencies have bought a type
      of product or service; and determining what contracts your competitors hold. In addition, you can search for your entities needs based on several categories, including entity, location, products and services.
