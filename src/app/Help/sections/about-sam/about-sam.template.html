  About Us
</h1>

<p>
  The General Service Administration’s (GSA) Office of the Integrated Award
  Environment (IAE) manages federal procurement and awards processes in ten
  online systems. These systems include:
</p>

<ul class="sam-ui bulleted list">
  <li>
    <strong>CFDA.gov</strong> (<em>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</em>)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>SAM.gov</strong> (<em>System for Award Management</em>)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>FBO.gov</strong> (<em>Federal Business Opportunities</em>)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>FPDS-NG.gov</strong> (<em>Federal Procurement Data System - Next Generation</em>)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>WDOL.gov</strong> (<em>Wage Determinations OnLine</em>)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>eSRS.gov</strong> (<em>Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System</em>)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>FAPIIS.gov</strong> (<em>Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System</em>)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>FSRS.gov</strong> (<em>Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act  Subaward Reporting System</em>)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>CPARS.gov</strong> (<em>Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System</em>)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>PPIRS.gov</strong> (<em>Past Performance Information Retrieval System</em>)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The Office of the IAE is in the process of merging these ten “legacy” sites into
  one system—the System for Award Management (SAM).
</p>

<p>
  SAM consolidates information from these systems into a single database,
  eliminating data overlap while sharing the data across the award lifecycle.
  SAM’s single home page provides access to all the capabilities previously
  found in the legacy systems. By streamlining processes and eliminating the need
  to enter the same data multiple times, SAM improves efficiency for all users.
</p>

<p>
  The new SAM site is a work in progress and currently exists as beta.SAM.gov.
  “Beta” means that the site is in the beginning stages of development. We
  encourage you to explore beta.SAM.gov, but keep in mind that it is not yet the
  authoritative source of information — you should still use the respective
  legacy systems until each is “retired.”
