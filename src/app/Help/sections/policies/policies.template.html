<p>
  The feedback surveys on beta.SAM.gov (information collections) meet the requirements
  of 44 U.S.C. ยง 3507, as amended by section 2 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.
  You do not need to answer these questions unless we display a valid Office of Management
  and Budget (OMB) control number. The OMB control number for our collections is 3090-0297.
  We estimate that it will take 3 minutes to read the instructions, gather the facts, and
  answer the questions. Send only comments relating to our time estimate, including
  suggestions for reducing this burden, or any other aspects of this collection of information
  to: General Services Administration, Regulatory Secretariat Division (MVCB), ATTN: Ms.
  Flowers/IC 3090-0297, 1800 F Street, NW, Washington, DC 20405.<br>
