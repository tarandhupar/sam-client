  User Accounts
</h1>

<p>
  SAM users can generally be grouped into three types: federal users, award 
  recipients (entity users), and public users. Depending on which type of user 
  you are, you may need to create a user account to access additional features 
  in SAM. 
</p>

<h2 class="sam-ui header">Sign Up Now</h2>

<p>
  You can now create your user account in SAM by clicking the 
  <a routerLink="/signup">Sign Up</a> link.
</p>

<p>
  While you won’t be able to access any additional capabilities yet, you can 
  prepare by creating your account now. When the additional features become 
  ready in the upcoming months, you’ll be ready to sign in.  
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Even if you have an existing account in one of the legacy systems 
  (e.g., SAM.gov, FBO.gov, CFDA.gov) you’ll need to create a new account for 
  beta.SAM.gov. In the future, after all of the individual systems are retired, 
  this account with be your only account for all of our features.
