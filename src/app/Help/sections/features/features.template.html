  A Single, Simple, More Effective Search
</h2>
<p>
  We changed the way we look at search in beta.SAM.gov, creating a single 
  search experience that includes all of our public award data. No matter 
  what data you are searching, your search begins at the top of our home page.
</p>
<p>
  Different types of award data, or “domains,” make up the heart of SAM. 
  You can either search across all domains or choose a specific domain to 
  search within a specific data set. Just enter a keyword, DUNS number, 
  CAGE code, etc. into the search bar to begin. To quickly narrow your 
  results, use the search filters.
</p>
<p>
  You can perform searches for public data without a user account. In the 
  future, you’ll be able to create a SAM account to save your search results 
  and access non-public data. 
</p>
<p>
  You can currently view detailed records for all domains. See the table 
  below to learn more about what information you can search for in each domain.
</p>

<table class="sam-ui definition table">
  <thead>
    <th scope="col" class="three wide">Domain</th>
    <th scope="col">Description</th>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>Assistance Listings</td>
    <td>
      Find assistance listings by entering a keyword, CFDA number, or agency 
      name into the search field.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Contract Opportunities</td>
    <td>
      Find contract opportunities by entering a keyword, solicitation ID, or an 
      agency name into the search field.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Contract Awards</td>
    <td>
      Find contract award data by entering a keyword, award type, NAICS Code, 
      PSC Code, or DUNS.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Entity Registrations</td>
    <td>
      <p>
        Find entity registrations by entering an entity’s name into the search 
        field. The search filter will automatically display “active” entities, 
        but you can also switch to view only inactive results. 
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Entity Exclusions</td>
    <td>
      <p>
        Find exclusions associated with a particular entity by entering the 
        entity’s name, DUNS number, or CAGE code. To search for an individual 
        person, type in his or her name. Be sure to confirm that you’ve found 
        the correct person—it’s easy to misidentify someone if he or she has a 
        common name. If no exclusion record is found for the entity, the entity 
        does not have an active exclusion in SAM.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Federal Hierarchy</td>
    <td>
      <p>
        Enter a department or sub-tier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use the Federal Hierarchy filter to narrow your results.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wage Determinations</td>
    <td>
      Find applicable DBA and SCA wage determinations required for each contract 
      action by entering a wage determination (WD) number, or using the filters 
      to narrow down your results by geographic location.
    </td>
  </tr>
