The President has delegated this waiver authority to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).  In acquisitions covered by the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement (WTO GPA), Free Trade Agreements, or the Israeli Trade Act, the USTR has waived the Buy American Act for eligible products from designated countries (FAR 25.003 and 25.402(a)(1)).  For procurements covered by the WTO GPA, FAR 25.502 provides that the agency may give the same consideration to offers of U.S.-made end products as the consideration given to eligible offers.  The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) has determined that for procurements covered by the WTO GPA, it is inconsistent with the public interest to apply the Buy American Act to end products that are substantially transformed in the United States (DFARS 225.103(a)(i)(B)).",
